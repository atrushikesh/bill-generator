I created a Bill Gererator interface where the customer can order two types of pizzas, a "Regular" one and a "Max" pizza.


Both of these have the option of veg and non veg.


There is also an option of the regular pizza for add-ons of :
1. Extra Cheeze
2. Extra Toppins


Both of these cost a few extra.


There is also option to take away with additional costs.
